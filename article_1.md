- Strengthen Relationships: Dedicate time each week to meaningful interactions with family, making sure to maintain strong bonds even with a busy schedule and always making sure i have time for loved ones.

-  Help family members achieve key life milestones, such as supporting my siblingâ€™s education or assisting with my parent's retirement when they do decide to retire.

- Take the lead in organizing at least one major family reunion or event that brings everyone together every year.

- Plan yearly family vacations to basically visit most of the world with my parents once I graduate from university.
